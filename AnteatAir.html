            <div class="text-wrapper">
                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    Design/Build/Fly is an annual competition hosted by the American Institute of Aeronautics and
                    Astronautics where participating universities design an RC aircraft to meet specific design criteria
                    described by a ruleset released in August and attend a fly-off held in either Wichita, Kansas or
                    Tucson, Arizona in April.
                    The 2024-2025 competition presented two unique design challenges: the inclusion of detachable
                    wing-mounted payloads and the deployment of a glider into a designated target area.
                    I'd wager the Design/Build/Fly team at UC Irvine faced a third challenge: a concerning lack of
                    returning members.
                    Many of the experienced members from the previous year graduated, leaving a team of mostly new
                    members.
                    Without anybody else to lead the way, I took on the role of project manager without knowing what it
                    entailed. The road ahead was uncertain, but I was determined to navigate it for the sake of the
                    team.
                    Throughout weeks and weeks of late nights, long meetings, and a fair share of setbacks, I helped
                    build a plane that made it all the way to the skies of Tucson, Arizona.
                    More importantly, I helped build a team that I am proud to be a part of.

                <h3>Design</h3>
                <p>
                    Unlike some of my personal projects, the design of AnteatAir was strictly governed by the
                    competition ruleset.
                    These rules determined the maximum wingspan, allowable configurations, electronics setup, and other
                    design parameters.
                    Most notably, the performance of the aircraft was evaluated based on scoring equations tied to each
                    mission.
                    These equations factored in elements such as payload weight, laps flown, and glider accuracy to
                    provide an overall score used to determine the top-placing teams.
                    One mission was heavily weighted towards the maximum weight the aircraft could carry using
                    wing-mounted payloads, while another prioritized the weight of the glider and its accuracy in
                    hitting a target.
                    A combination of hand calculations, optimization scripts, simulations, and real flight tests were
                    used to arrive at a final design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The final design was a 6-ft wingspan, 10-inch chord, mid-wing conventional aircraft with a tricycle
                    configuration landing gear.
                    The aircraft was powered by a 4500mAh 6s LiPo battery, a SunnySky X4130-8 380kV motor, and an 18x10E
                    propeller.
                    The wings, tails, and fuselage were constructed using built-up balsa with plywood and carbon fiber
                    reinforcements.
                    The wings were detachable to facilitate transportation and access panels were incorporated into the
                    fuselage for battery and electronics access.
                    The wing-mounted payloads were plastic soda bottles attached using a custom 3D-printed mounting
                    system for rapid installation and removal.
                    The glider was a modified off-the-shelf foam glider with fixed control surfaces to initiate an
                    controlled descent pattern and an onboard LED-system for visbility.
                    The glider was released using an internal servo-actuated mechanism connected to hooks on the
                    glider's underside.

                <h3>Aerodynamics</h3>
                <p>
                    As the aerodynamics lead, I was responsible for the aerodynamic design and analysis of the aircraft.
                    I performed scoring analysis, preliminary sizing, and performance validation using a combination of
                    hand calculations, MATLAB scripts, and XFLR5 simulations.
                    I developed an optimization program in MATLAB that combined the scoring equations with early
                    performance estimates and aerodynamic equations to determine the highest-scoring balance of design
                    parameters.
                    A separate sensitivity analysis graphically compared the relative impact of variations in each of
                    the design parameters to validate the optimization results.
                    The initial aircraft was sized based off of these results and techniques described in rudimentary
                    aircraft design textbooks.
                    XFLR5 was used to simulate the aircraft's aerodynamic performance and stability characteristics,
                    allowing for changes to the airfoil selection, wing geometry, and tail sizing prior to building a
                    physical prototype.
                    Flight testing allowed for real-world performance validation and final adjustments to further
                    increase performance.

                <h3>Project Management</h3>
                <p>
                    Although I picked up a lot of technical skills throughout the year, I think my greatest takeaway is
                    how much effort it takes to be a good leader.
                    As project manager, I handled meetings, budgeting, scheduling, task delegation, communication with
                    advisors, and any unexpected issues that arose along the way.
                    Early on, I struggled to find my footing in this new role. At the first meeting, I faced a room full
                    of new members who were unsure of what to expect, and I was unsure of what to deliver.
                    My mind was focused on how much time it would take to build a plane and not on how to build a
                    lasting team.
                    I spent too much time doing things by myself, and I felt the consequences. I burned out and spiraled
                    into feelings of inadequacy, self-doubt, and frustration.
                    It wasn't until I took a step back and take a moment to breathe that I was able to turn things
                    around.
                    The team came first, and results would follow. During crunch time, I stepped away completely from
                    any hands-on work and focused entirely on keeping the team organized, motivated, and on track.
                    Before I knew it, we were on our way to Tucson, on a journey I'd be hard-pressed to forget.
                </p>

            <div class="text-wrapper">
                <h3>Results</h3>
                <p>
                    I'd love to talk about producing great results, but that was far from reality. We placed 59th of 112
                    competing teams, completing only two of the four missions.
                    The road was riddled with too many mistakes, many of which were my own. Yet, I am hopeful for the
                    future of the team and for good reason;
                    this year we have seventeen returning members, each with far more experience in the project than my
                    past self.
                    We're already making smarter decisions and working harder to make this year better than the last.
